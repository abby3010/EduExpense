This application will be there for accounting & keeping record for all day to day expenses
Also if someone gave money to a friend , a constant reminder will be given to a person depending after how much time he wants himself to be reminded (weekly/monthly/yearly)
If it is a business transaction then also the feature of how much interest to be charged & hence how much to take from the other person after a period of time & also if he wants him to pay in installments or collective payment at the end of the term .
Vice-versa would also be there , if I owe money to someone whether it will be a friendly or business transaction . If business then how much to save per month to be able to repay his debt in time .

Another feature will be added that is to educate people and simultaneously make people financially literate & show people how they can diversify their investments to make maximum profits & make them aware of the opportunities available . Also there will be an add-on section linked to the web where if someone who’s way more keen to know about financial education, we will be having a blog section where expert’s articles throughout the world will be published on their respective topic of expertise .
